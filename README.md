# Day 5 - Random Forest Regression (Air Quality Prediction)

## 📌 Project Overview
As part of my **100 Days of Machine Learning Challenge**, today I explored **Random Forest Regression**.  
The goal of this project is to predict the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** based on different pollutant levels such as PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, and O₃.

## 🎯 Goal
- Input: Air pollutant concentrations (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃)
- Output: Predicted AQI value

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## 📊 Results
- **R² Score**: 0.94  
- Random Forest captures non-linear patterns better than simple regression.

## 🧠 Learning
Random Forest is an **ensemble algorithm** that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.  
It works well when the relationship between features and target is complex and non-linear.
